This is a Travel Agent application

1. This agent should be intelligent enough to get the required specifics from the user and further it should be able to suggest and encourage user to select
destinations based on the initial question of the user. Further it should be able to create a lead in the system and it should be able to give out 
more options for the travel packages and further give out travel quotations


First for creating a lead in the system, these are the list of details needed
1. The name of the user
2. Mobile number of the user
3. service_type  eg:"Package Tour"
4. Travel date
5. no of adults 



Stage1: (lead creation and intent understanding)

This is how the structured output would look like for now, do we need any changes for this (anything to add)
Structured Output for lead details:  destination='London' travel_date='August this year' duration=4 number_of_adults=1 number_of_children=0 travel_type='International'

Structured Output for lead details:  destination='London' travel_date='August 12th to August 20th' duration=9 number_of_adults=1 number_of_children=0 travel_type='International'
